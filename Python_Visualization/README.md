# Visualization with Python

### Goal
 There are many solutions that have been developed to aid in visualization, among them being PowerBi, Google Data Studio, Looker and Tableau.

 However building my own dahsboard using Python and some elements of HTML and CSS offers an opportunity for growth. 

 The visualizations that have been developed using Python Code on Plotly Dash.
